Real Time Bus Tracker

This project uses the MapBox API to show the path along all the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. The addition that I made to this project was to add a line to show the path between each bus stop location.

How to Run: The HTML, CSS, and JS files can bee downloaded to one's local machine. One can run opeen the HTML file in a browser to run the app.

Roadmap of future improvements: The next feature to add to this app is to show markers at every location there is a bus stop instead of only the final location.
